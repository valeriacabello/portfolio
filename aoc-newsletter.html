                <h2>Newsletter</h2>
                <p>The Arizona Outdoors Club was struggling to keep registered and prospective members informed about club activities and news. To resolve this, I developed a brand strategy to execute into a newsletter that attracts and keeps the audience engaged.</p>
                <img src="images/AOC-newsletter.jpg">
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>As the new graphic designer and marketing director for the club, I looked through marketing projects and design work that existed before I joined to see what I had to work with. When I looked at the newsletter, I saw a huge opportunity. All I saw on it were blocks of text and not much consideration for hierarchy and color. The only form of branding I could see was at the top on the header image.</p>
                <p class="bold">What was given to me:</p>
                <img src="images/AOC-newsletter-originalVersion.png" alt="A newsletter that has a horizontal header image and three blocks of text, each block a different color.">
                <p>I tackled this as a challenge of creating a new brand that would be consistent not just on the newsletter but also on merch, flyers, and beyond. After that, I went back to the newsletter and approached it with a strong use of imagery in mind.</p>
                <p>Outdoor excursions are the main event at the outdoors club so why not make them the center of the newsletter? I knew that this was something club members were most interested in being informed about because I talked to them during my time in the club.</p>
                <img src="images/AOC-newsletter-header.png">
                <p>I had this idea of using one big image inspiring the outdoors lifestyle to attract readers. The image would be one that was taken by a club member and I'd give them the attribution to show a sense of community.</p>
                <p>Over this image, I would list the outdoor trips that were available so that the reader could see right away what trips they could go on. I also wanted to make sure that the readers could see who the email is from at the top.</p>
                <p>In the body section of the newsletter, I wanted to have important announcements display first in their own section, followed by a section for upcoming trips.</p>
                <img src="images/AOC-newsletter-trips.png">
                <p>Each trip would use an image to make the email look less wordy and keep the readers engaged. The image would be followed by details about the trip.</p>
                <p>Below the trips section, I'd include any other relevant club events and instructions on how to become a member.</p>
                <img src="images/AOC-newsletter-events.png">
                <img src="images/AOC-newsletter-membership.png">
                <p>For the footer, I wanted to have a call to action and show the club's sponsors.</p>
                <img src="images/AOC-newsletter-footer.png">
                <p>I wanted to make sure to include helpful links, social media profiles, and a reply button. The sponsors would be important to include as a thank you and to let the reader know about discounts they were offered.</p>
                <p>I took all of those ideas to create the newsletter on MailChimp using the brand that I designed. At the end of my first year as marketing director and graphic designer, I conducted a survey to learn about what club members enjoyed seeing on the newsletter and what they wish they could've seen. I then implemented the findings into my designs the following year.</p>
